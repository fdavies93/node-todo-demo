# Todo Node Demo App

A straightforward port of the [Flask Todo App](https://github.com/fdavies93/todo-demo) backend into Node.js / Express, using Docker workflow.

Differs from the current version of the Flask Todo App by using proper HTTP verbs (DELETE and PATCH) rather than including these in the URI. This reflects this demo's intention as a dedicated backend.
